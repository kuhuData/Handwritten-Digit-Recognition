# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project


## Description

This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using the MNIST dataset and a neural network. The system is capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits and displaying the predictions. It serves as an introductory example to neural network-based image classification.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
2. The script will display training progress and evaluation metrics.
3. The trained model will be saved for later use.

## Data Preprocessing

- The MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in function.
- Images are normalized to a range of 0 to 1.
- Labels are one-hot encoded for classification.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of layers designed to extract features from images:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for down-sampling
- Fully connected layers for classification

The model architecture is defined and compiled using TensorFlow's Keras API.

## Training

- The model is trained on the training dataset.
- Training progress is displayed, showing loss and accuracy.
- Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

- The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported.
